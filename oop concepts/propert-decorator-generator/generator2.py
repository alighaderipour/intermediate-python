Professional Python programmers use generators in many real-world applications, especially when handling large data streams, processing pipelines, asynchronous programming, and memory-efficient operations. Below are more practical use cases where generators are commonly applied.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Processing Large Log Files Efficiently
Use Case:
Processing logs line by line without loading the entire file into memory.

python
Copy
Edit
def read_logs(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

for log in read_logs('server_logs.txt'):
    if "ERROR" in log:
        print(f"Critical Issue Found: {log}")  # Only processes one line at a time
Why?
Efficient memory usage: No need to load the entire log file.
Real-time processing: Can analyze logs on-the-fly.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Streaming Data from APIs
Use Case:
Fetching data from a paginated API without storing all responses at once.

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

def fetch_api_data(url):
    while url:
        response = requests.get(url).json()
        yield response['data']
        url = response.get('next_page_url')  # Get next page URL

for batch in fetch_api_data("https://api.example.com/data"):
    process(batch)  # Process each batch without keeping everything in memory
Why?
No need to store all data at once.
Efficiently handles large paginated responses.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Data Stream Processing
Use Case:
Processing sensor data or live stock market data efficiently.

python
Copy
Edit
import random
import time

def temperature_sensor():
    while True:
        yield random.uniform(20.0, 30.0)  # Simulated temperature reading
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulate real-time data delay

for temp in temperature_sensor():
    print(f"Live Temperature: {temp:.2f}¬∞C")
Why?
Continuous data streaming without storing unnecessary values.
Saves memory compared to collecting all readings in a list.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Generating Infinite Unique Identifiers
Use Case:
Generating unique IDs dynamically when needed (e.g., for database records).

python
Copy
Edit
import itertools

def unique_id_generator(prefix="ID"):
    counter = itertools.count(1)  # Infinite counter starting from 1
    while True:
        yield f"{prefix}-{next(counter)}"

gen = unique_id_generator()
print(next(gen))  # Output: ID-1
print(next(gen))  # Output: ID-2
print(next(gen))  # Output: ID-3
Why?
Avoids storing all IDs in memory.
Works well for dynamic ID assignment.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Batched Data Processing
Use Case:
Processing large datasets in fixed-size batches (e.g., in ML pipelines).

python
Copy
Edit
def batch_generator(data, batch_size):
    batch = []
    for item in data:
        batch.append(item)
        if len(batch) == batch_size:
            yield batch
            batch = []
    if batch:
        yield batch  # Yield remaining items

data = range(100)  # Simulated large dataset
for batch in batch_generator(data, 10):
    print(batch)  # Output: batches of size 10
Why?
Avoids processing all data at once.
Memory-efficient batch loading for ML or database operations.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Streaming Large CSV Files
Use Case:
Reading large CSV files without loading the entire file.

python
Copy
Edit
import csv

def read_large_csv(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        next(reader)  # Skip header
        for row in reader:
            yield row  # Yield each row one at a time

for row in read_large_csv('large_data.csv'):
    print(row)  # Process one row at a time
Why?
Handles very large CSV files efficiently.
Prevents high memory usage by processing row-by-row.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing a Lazy Database Query Iterator
Use Case:
Fetching large amounts of data efficiently from a database.

python
Copy
Edit
import sqlite3

def fetch_large_query(db_path, query):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    while (row := cursor.fetchone()) is not None:
        yield row
    conn.close()

for record in fetch_large_query('database.db', "SELECT * FROM large_table"):
    print(record)  # Process each row one by one
Why?
Avoids loading large result sets into memory.
Ideal for processing millions of records.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Generating Combinations Dynamically
Use Case:
Generating combinations or permutations for large datasets without storing them.

python
Copy
Edit
from itertools import permutations

def permute_generator(iterable):
    for perm in permutations(iterable):
        yield perm  # Yield each permutation one by one

for perm in permute_generator("ABC"):
    print(perm)  # Output: ('A', 'B', 'C'), ('A', 'C', 'B'), ...
Why?
Prevents storing a massive list of permutations.
Generates values on-the-fly, reducing memory usage.
9Ô∏è‚É£ Processing Streaming Video or Audio
Use Case:
Processing media files in chunks rather than all at once.

python
Copy
Edit
def read_video_frames(video_path, chunk_size=1024):
    with open(video_path, 'rb') as video:
        while (chunk := video.read(chunk_size)):
            yield chunk  # Yield small chunks of data

for frame in read_video_frames('video.mp4'):
    process(frame)  # Process each video chunk
Why?
Handles large video/audio files efficiently.
Prevents memory overload by streaming in chunks.
üîü Efficiently Filtering Large Datasets
Use Case:
Filtering records without loading everything into memory.

python
Copy
Edit
def filter_large_dataset(data, condition):
    for item in data:
        if condition(item):
            yield item  # Yield only matching records

large_dataset = range(1000000)  # Simulated large dataset
filtered_results = filter_large_dataset(large_dataset, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)

print(next(filtered_results))  # Output: 0
print(next(filtered_results))  # Output: 2
print(next(filtered_results))  # Output: 4
Why?
Doesn't require storing all filtered items in memory.
Processes data dynamically.
